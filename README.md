# Credo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rrrene/credo.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rrrene/credo)

This will be an opinionated analysis tool for Elixir, as soon as I get the last bugs fixed for an initial release.


## History

Credo started as an experimental wrapper around [Dogma](https://github.com/lpil/dogma), which is the code you see in the repo at the moment.
